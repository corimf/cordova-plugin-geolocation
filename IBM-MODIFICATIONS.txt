- Cherry-pick the removal of the Geolocation plugin from Android.
  We had already disabled this plugin with with RTC story 36983 but have
  since been playing games and tricks when buildling the source zip. This commit
  properly removes the plugin. Cherry-pick: ab8a448e52b0. The native plugin was somehow
  accidently added back into the 3.4.0esr stream; this commit removes it from that stream.
