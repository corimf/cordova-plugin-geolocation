- Full description: Using the built-in webview navigator.geolocation requires a
  new key added to the info.plist file for iOS 8. This is just added in the
  plugin.xml file for geolocation and the issue is resolved.  For the Cordova
  Geolocation plugin, the issue requires the change above plus a change to the
  CDVLocation.m file in the plugin. The iOS8 SDK changed the API for requesting
  permission to access location. Therefore, changes had to be made on the
  native side to account for that.
