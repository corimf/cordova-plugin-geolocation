- Worklight RTC work item number:
- Full description: Using the built-in webview navigator.geolocation requires a
new key added to the info.plist file for iOS 8. This is just added in the
plugin.xml file for geolocation and the issue is resolved. For the Cordova
Geolocation plugin, the issue requires the change above plus a change to the
CDVLocation.m file in the plugin. The iOS8 SDK changed the API for requesting
permission to access location. Therefore, changes had to be made on the
native side to account for that.

- Worklight RTC work item number: 55790
- Full description: Customer reported on SO that a bb10 app asked for geo permission every time the app was run in 3.1. This was a bug that was reported and fixed for Cordova 3.4 (see CB-5334) by using a proxy. The proxy introduced a regression in watchLocation which was fixed in CB-5729. This is a cherry pick of both those commits - cb586fd followed by f2a355d.
